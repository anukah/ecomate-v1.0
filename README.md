# Ecomate ðŸŒ¿

A handheld, Arduino-based IoT vehicle emission tester. It monitors CO and HC levels. Data is processed and transmitted to a mobile app built with Expo for real-time tracking using an ESP32 Wi-Fi module. Ecomate provides a portable solution for emission testing, promoting cleaner and safer environments and vehicle health.
